# Striver's SDE Sheet Solutions

## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey and solutions as I tackle [Striver's SDE Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/), a curated list of coding interview problems to help prepare for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) interviews. The purpose of creating this repository is to track my progress, reflect on learning, and share solutions with those who are also on the path of technical interview preparation.

## Why This Repository?
- **Track Progress:** To keep a record of my progress as I solve each problem from the Striver's SDE Sheet.
- **Reflect on Learning:** To document the challenges faced and the learnings gleaned from each problem.
- **Share and Collaborate:** To provide a platform for feedback and discussion with peers and mentors.

## Repository Structure
- `Solutions/`: Contains all my solutions to the problems listed in the Striver's SDE Sheet.
- `Resources/`: Additional resources and notes related to DSA concepts.
- `ProgressTracker.md`: A markdown file to track the progress of problems solved.

## Progress Tracker
I have created a `ProgressTracker.md` to keep track of the problems I have solved. The tracker is structured as follows:

```markdown
| #   | Title                                      | Solution Link | Difficulty | Status    | Date Completed |
|-----|--------------------------------------------|---------------|------------|-----------|----------------|
| 1   | Problem Name                               | [Link]()      | Easy/Medium/Hard | Not Started/In Progress/Completed | YYYY-MM-DD     |
| ... | ...                                        | ...           | ...        | ...       | ...            |
